You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Concorde Installed Workspace Gate

Before any hook, setup step, prerequisite check, or artifact access, run `.venv/bin/python .specify/extensions/concorde/scripts/python/workspace.py --phase taskstoissues` from the target
project root and parse its canonical JSON. Stop on any status other than `resolved` or `selected`. Use
the returned `workspace.feature_directory`, `workspace.feature_design`, `workspace.feature_implementation`, durable `workspace.*_dir` fields,
`workspace.attempt_dir`, plan-phase paths, and `workspace.attempt_state` as the sole path authority.
Require Protocol v9 `workspace.workspace_kind`, `workspace.feature_id`, `workspace.providing_module`,
`workspace.parent_context`, and bounded `workspace.siblings`. Treat `workspace.module_summary` and
`workspace.module_design` as navigation references that are never loaded implicitly: read `module.md`
only where a phase names it as bounded context, and open the module `design.md` only for a specific
recorded detail and cite it. When `workspace_kind` is `subfeature`,
read the parent `feature_design` and `feature_implementation` only as aggregate durable context. Never load a
sibling design/implementation body or any parent/sibling `attempt/` artifact implicitly, and
write only through the selected sub-feature's returned paths.

Do not execute a later core helper that would re-resolve a root-level plan or task path. When a later
step says to run `.venv/bin/python .specify/extensions/concorde/scripts/python/workspace.py --phase taskstoissues`, reuse or refresh this installed-adapter result. Derive `AVAILABLE_DOCS`
by checking the returned durable and temporal paths. For `plan` or `tasks`, create the returned
`attempt_dir` when absent and seed a missing artifact from the active `plan-template` or
`tasks-template` resolved by `specify preset resolve`; never create a feature-root compatibility copy.
For `checklist`, resolve `checklist-template` separately through the same public preset resolver.

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before tasks-to-issues conversion)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_taskstoissues` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing command invocations from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `$speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

1. Run `.venv/bin/python .specify/extensions/concorde/scripts/python/workspace.py --phase taskstoissues` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR, ATTEMPT_DIR, TASKS, and AVAILABLE_DOCS. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
1. **IF EXISTS**: Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for project principles and governance constraints.
1. From the executed script, use the returned absolute **TASKS** path (`ATTEMPT_DIR/tasks.md`).
1. Get the Git remote by running:

```bash
git config --get remote.origin.url
```

> [!CAUTION]
> ONLY PROCEED TO NEXT STEPS IF THE REMOTE IS A GITHUB URL

1. **Fetch existing issues for deduplication**: Before creating anything, build the set of task IDs you are about to process from `tasks.md` (each is a `T` followed by **at least** three digits, e.g. `T001` — `$speckit-converge` assigns new IDs with `T{M+1:03d}`, which is a floor rather than a cap, so once a file has more than 999 tasks the IDs are four digits or longer). Then use the GitHub MCP server's `list_issues` tool to look for issues that already cover those IDs. Do not pass a `state` value, since omitting it makes the tool return both open and closed issues. Request `perPage: 100` to keep the number of calls down, and since the tool uses cursor-based pagination, request pages with the `after` parameter (using the `endCursor` from the previous response). For each issue title, match it against the task ID pattern `\bT\d{3,}\b` (the `{3,}` accepts four-digit and longer IDs — with `\d{3}` a title containing `T1000` would not match at all, because the trailing `\b` cannot fall between two digits, so that task would be silently neither deduplicated nor created; word boundaries still stop a token like `ST001` from matching, and force the whole digit run to be consumed so `T100` can never match inside `T1000`; this also recognises titles written as `T001 ...`, `T001: ...` or `[T001] ...`) and, when it matches one of your task IDs, mark that ID as already having an issue. Stop paginating as soon as every task ID has been matched, or when there are no more pages, so you do not keep fetching the whole repository's issue history once all task IDs are accounted for. This bounds the number of calls on repos with large issue histories and still prevents duplicates when the command is re-run after `tasks.md` is regenerated or the skill is re-invoked.
1. For each task in the list, use the GitHub MCP server to create a new issue in the repository that is representative of the Git remote. Task lines in `tasks.md` start with a markdown checkbox, so first strip the leading `- [ ]` (and any `[P]` / `[US#]` markers) to recover the task ID and its description. Create the issue with a single canonical title of the form `T001: <description>`, with the ID written once followed by the task description (for example, the line `- [ ] T001 Create project structure` becomes the title `T001: Create project structure`).
   - **Skip** any task whose ID is already present in the set of existing issues from the previous step, and report it (for example, `T001 already has an issue, skipping`).
   - Only create issues for tasks that do not yet have a matching issue.

> [!CAUTION]
> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EVER CREATE ISSUES IN REPOSITORIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THE REMOTE URL

## Post-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (after tasks-to-issues conversion)**:
Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_taskstoissues` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing command invocations from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `$speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`).
