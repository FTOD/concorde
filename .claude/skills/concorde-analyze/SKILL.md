# concorde-analyze

Invoke this Operation to analyze. The host owns context
resolution, agent execution, permissions, and lifecycle state. Supply the user's task as typed
input; do not perform it directly in this ambient conversation or inspect additional project files.

Send one concorde-operation-invocation@2 JSON object on stdin to `python3 scripts/run-operation.py operations/concorde-analyze/operation.py`. Its exact fields
are type_id, schema_version:2, operation_id:"concorde-analyze", mode:"execute" or "describe-policy",
configuration (null to load initialized host settings, or a matching concorde-operation-configuration@1), and input (concorde-analyze-request@1).
Task requests select target_id and task, with optional focus_id, constraints, and change_id.
Initialization/migration use their typed propose/apply requests; use the published request schema.
No domain flags or positional task arguments are accepted. Configuration is never a context grant.

Use the supplied target identity; if it is ambiguous, ask the user to identify it instead of
searching other Specs. The host captures a committed-base worktree for mutations when necessary.
Its result names that workspace. Report Spec gaps or blocked execution as returned; do not work
around the boundary. Non-implementation agents never receive implementation code or raw test logs.

## Input TypedValue schema

This complete schema is the invocation's input field. It does not grant project reads.
