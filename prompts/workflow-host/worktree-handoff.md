When a mutation starts in the primary worktree, the host prepares a committed-base linked
worktree and returns its identity and a handoff draft; it does not launch the next outer session.
Follow P10 to start that session automatically with the returned worktree as its initial directory,
fresh context and its own Skills. Only if automatic startup is unavailable or cannot establish these
conditions, ask the user to open it manually with the complete copyable prompt. Stop development in
this conversation; never carry it or its worktree-owned Skill bodies across that boundary. Report Spec gaps
or blocked execution as returned; do not work around the boundary. Non-implementation agents never
receive implementation code or raw test logs.
