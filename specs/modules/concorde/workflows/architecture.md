# Architecture

The public boundary is a versioned TypedValue invocation of an installed concorde-* Skill. Global calls select the owning Module; lifecycle calls perform declared deterministic actions. A planner determines tasks from the selected Module Spec alone. Code writers additionally receive referenced Implementation Specs. Each stage reports its own completion and gaps; a completed component does not independently deliver the enclosing change.

## Internal domain

Agents bind responsibility instructions, a Harness and constraints. Invocations carry context and task identity; graphs coordinate handoffs, stages, feedback and completion. The query, development, topology, review and delivery documents describe this Module's behavior. These topic documents are parts of one self-contained Module Spec, not separate submodules.

## Relied-upon Module promises

Each declaration below is local contract content. It grants no access to the provider's remaining Spec or implementation.

    "relied_upon_promises": [
      "resolve_context selects one Module and its complete registered documents. Feature focus never trims the collection. Non-code phases do not receive Implementation Specs or source. The implementation phase adds only the referenced Implementation Specs and exact bound files. Membership, bytes, rules and admitted stage inputs determine context identity."

    "relied_upon_promises": [
      "SpecRepository reads registry schema 2. select returns a Module descriptor. Implementation records form a separate index, file_implementations maps each declared file to one owner, and implementation_users maps each Implementation Spec to all using Modules. Lookups never follow a relationship to read another Spec body."

      "TypedValue envelopes identify a type, version and data. Unknown fields, unsupported identities and malformed values fail admission. File-path helpers reject traversal and aliases. Schema validation is deterministic and offline; a validation error never grants a different context or fallback authority."

    "relied_upon_promises": [
      "AgentProcessExecutor accepts a host-built LaunchSpecification, verifies the Agent/Harness binding and effective policy, starts the selected model integration and validates completion evidence.
